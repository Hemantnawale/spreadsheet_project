### **Step 3: Open the Repository**
- From the list of your repositories, click on the repository you want to delete.

### **Step 4: Go to Repository Settings**
- In the repository menu (at the top of the page), click on the **Settings** tab (usually on the far right).

---

### **Step 5: Scroll to the Danger Zone**
- On the **Settings** page, scroll down to the section labeled **"Danger Zone."**
- Look for the option that says **"Delete this repository."**

---

### **Step 6: Confirm Deletion**
1. Click on **"Delete this repository."**
2. A pop-up window will appear asking for confirmation.
3. Type the repository name as shown (e.g., `username/repository-name`) to confirm.
4. Click the **"I understand the consequences, delete this repository"** button.

### **Step 7: Repository Deleted**
- Your repository is now permanently deleted.
- You’ll be redirected to your repository list, and the deleted repository will no longer appear.

### **Tips**:
- Double-check that you no longer need the repository, as this action is **permanent**.
- Consider downloading or archiving the repository if you might need it in the future.
